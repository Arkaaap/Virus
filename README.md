Example of Dijkstra algorithm

Step 1 : Start with a weighted graph. Step 2 : Choose a starting vertex and assign infinity path values to all other devices. Step 3 : Go to each vertex and update its path length. Step 4 : If the path length of the adjacent vertex is less than new path length, don't update i
